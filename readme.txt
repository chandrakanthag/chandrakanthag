ILuvType
A CSS+HTML5-based template.
Designed by Alex Holt (http://soyrex.com)

ILuvType is a clean, typographic heavy theme that uses simple device fonts as a design element to create a clean, easy on the eyes, high contrast reading environment.

The theme includes 4 page templates and a series of 5 different highlight colour schemes.

The theme validates as HTML5 - it uses a small amount of Javascript and Jquery to achieve the necessary effects.
